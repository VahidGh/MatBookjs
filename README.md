## MatBook.js

[MatBook.js](https://github.com/vahidgh/MatBookjs) enables scientists, researchers, and students to create and share interactive mathematical problems and solutions with real-time 3D simulations. It provides a platform for creating and sharing mathematical books, tutorials, and educational materials.

### MathWiki.js

[MathWiki.js](https://github.com/vahidgh/mathwikijs) is a project aimed at providing a comprehensive encyclopedia and an efficient mathematical solutions implemented in JavaScript. This project besides implementing a comprehensive encyclopedia of mathematical concepts and solutions, also provides a flexible and interactive environment for mathematical computations and data analysis.

The main concepts of Mathematical problems, their roots and applications are described using invaluable resources like [The Encyklopadie der Mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluss ihrer Anwendungen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein%27s_Encyclopedia_of_Mathematical_Sciences) by [F. Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein).

### BioMedWiki.js
[BioMedWiki.js](https://github.com/vahidgh/biomedwikijs) is a project aimed at providing a comprehensive encyclopedia of biomedical engineering concepts and applications implemented in JavaScript. This project provides a flexible and interactive environment for biomedical engineering, computations and data analysis.

The main concepts of biomedical engineering applications are provided using invaluable resources like [Encyclopedia of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780128158024/encyclopedia-of-biomaterials-and-biomedical-engineering) by [D.A. Lauffenburger](https://www.med.upenn.edu/bioengineering/faculty/lauffenburger/). Users can choose, annotate or refer to the entries in the encyclopedia to create their own knowledge-base.
